# 🌍 Uncertainty Assessment in Deep Learning-based Plant Trait Retrievals from Hyperspectral Data

![Workflow](workflow.png)

## 📌 Description
With the advent of **Hyperspectral satellites** and **Deep Learning**, we have the chance to monitor **biodiversity on a global scale** as a contribution to **global digital data streams**. 

However, there is still a need for **methods that fully report the uncertainty** of deep learning-derived products. In this regard, this study introduces **Dis_UN**, a **novel distance-based method** for estimating **predictive uncertainty** in deep learning models for **plant trait retrievals**.

Unlike traditional uncertainty estimation approaches, **Dis_UN** quantifies **worst-case errors** by:
- Using **residuals** as a proxy for uncertainty.
- Measuring **dissimilarity in data manifolds**.

### 🔹 Key Findings:
- **Dis_UN effectively detects Out-Of-Domain (OOD) spectral variations**, such as **urban surfaces, clouds, and open water**.
- Provides **more reliable uncertainty estimates** compared to conventional methods, which often underestimate uncertainty.
- With the increasing availability of **hyperspectral data**, robust uncertainty quantification is **crucial for Earth Observation applications**.
- This method contributes to **uncertainty quantification in machine learning-derived maps**, offering a **practical tool for uncertainty assessment** valuable for **ecological and environmental analyses**.
